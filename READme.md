# Scientific WEB 

## This website consist of 10 pages without INTRO page

## First Page:
- Balancing ---> you can enter the reactant and the products without any coe for the compounds or element and the program will balance it

## Second Page

- Quantative ---> you can measure the molarity and molality just by tell me the molcular formula of the solute and will calcute the molar mass directly and give me the total mass of the solute then (mass or volume)
